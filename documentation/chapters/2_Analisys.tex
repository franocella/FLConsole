\section{Requirements}

In this section, we outline the functional and non-functional requirements necessary for the successful implementation of the project.

\subsection{Functional Requirements}

\subsubsection{For Administrators:}

\begin{itemize}
    \item Administrators must be able to log in to the application.
    \item Administrators must be able to log out of the application securely.
    \item Administrators must be able to create new configurations for experiments.
    \item Administrators must be able to create experiments based on the configurations they have defined.
    \item Administrators must be able to initiate experiments and oversee their execution.
    \item Administrators must be able to view other administrators' experiments.
    \item Administrators must possess the authority to perform CRUD operations on configurations and experiments.
\end{itemize}

\subsubsection{For Users:}

\begin{itemize}
    \item Users must be able to log in to the application.
    \item Users must be able to log out of the application securely.
    \item Users must be able to register for a new account within the application.
    \item Users must be able to search for experiments based on configuration and experiment names.
    \item Users must be able to monitor real-time progress of experiments.
\end{itemize}

\newpage
\subsection{Non-Functional Requirements}

\begin{enumerate}
    \item \textbf{Performance:} The system must handle a large number of concurrent users without significant performance degradation. Response times for critical operations should be kept within acceptable limits.
    \item \textbf{Reliability:} The system should be highly available with minimal downtime. 
    \item \textbf{Security:} User authentication and authorization mechanisms must be implemented.
    \item \textbf{Scalability:} The system should scale horizontally to accommodate increasing user loads and data volumes.
    \item \textbf{Usability:} The user interface must be intuitive and error messages must be informative.
    \item \textbf{Maintainability:} The codebase must be well-organized and documentation must be comprehensive.
    \item \textbf{Compatibility:} The application must be compatible with a wide range of web browsers and devices. Integration with external systems must be seamless.
\end{enumerate}

\section{Use Case Diagram}
\subsection{Actors}

The actors who can interact with the web console system consist of the following:
\begin{itemize}
    \item \textbf{User:} The user is the actor who can browse the system to view running and completed experiments and their results.
    \item \textbf{Admin:} The admin is the actor who can manage the system, including creating and deleting configurations and experiments, and viewing the results of experiments.
\end{itemize}

\subsection{Scenarios}
In the following tables, we present several key use cases related to the management and execution of experiments within the application. These use cases cover actions performed by different actors, including users and administrators, and describe the steps involved in each scenario, along with pre-conditions and post-conditions.
